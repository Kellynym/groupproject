       <h2>Eli's Italian Ice is not just another regular frozen treat!</h2>

        <br>
        <p> We are a company with a mission, which is to serve our customers an affordable, yet uncompromising
            quality frozen eating experience! It is our goal to mesmerize your taste buds,
            while tickling your fancy as you enjoy the fun of flavor on a hot Summer
            afternoon.
        </p>

        <p>Eli’s Italian Ice became the answer to a Grandmother’s love for her grandson,
            Elijah, who exhibited food allergies to ice cream at the tender age of two. Try
            telling a two-year-old that he cannot eat ice cream because it does not agree with
            him. Exactly! It does not work. This effort lead to the search for a delectable and
            fun treat that kids old and young could enjoy time and time again without cause
            for worry. Of course, this treat had to be one that did not leave Eli concerned
            about sticky fingers and washing his hands every 2 minutes! Fortunately, our
            journey was very short. Playing with freezing fruit on days too tired to look for
            non-dairy treats, Eli’s Ice was born.

        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
